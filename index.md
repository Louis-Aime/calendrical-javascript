# Calendrical routines in javascript
A set of basic routines javascript for computations on calendars.

From this site (https://louis-aime.github.io/calendrical-javascript/) you can:
* launch the  demonstrators to the calendrical-javascript routines,
* read the JSDoc generated documentation.

## Main GitHub repository
[Link to the calendrical-javascript GitHub repository](https://github.com/Louis-Aime/calendrical-javascript)

## Demonstrator usage
With the first panel, choose a custom calendar, then enter a date in this calendar. 
If you use the "Real Gregorian" calendar, you can specify the switching day to New Style Gregorian.
With the next panels, specify the display options. You may choose a Unicode built-in calendar.
The date projected are displayed in the last panels.
The first panel also shows the week figures, with which you can specify a date.

## JSDoc reader's guide
The modules and the classes within the modules are described under the *Modules* and *Classes* JSDoc pages. 
The structure of a custom calendar, that the user should provide, is described the *customcalendarmodel* module.
The *Global* page mostly describes scripts of the demonstrator. Have a look on *loadCalendrical* and *calendrical*
as examples for your personal implementation. 
Under the documentation for module *calendars*, you find the list of custom calendars ready for use.
