# Calendrical routines in javascript
A set of basic routines javascript for computations on calendars.

From this site (https://louis-aime.github.io/calendrical-javascript/) you can:
* launch the  demonstrators to the calendrical-javascript routines,
* read the JSDoc generated documentation.

## Main GitHub repository
[Link to the calendrical-javascript GitHub repository](https://github.com/Louis-Aime/calendrical-javascript)

## Demonstrator usage
With the first panel, choose a custom calendar, then enter a date in this calendar. 
If you use the "historic" calendar, you can specify the switching day to Gregorian.
With the next panels, specify the display options. You may choose a Unicode built-in calendar.
The date projected are displayed in the last panels.
The first panel also shows the week figures, with which you can specify a date.

## Links to the demonstrators

 * [Calendrical demonstrator, English](./calendrical-demo-en)
 
## JSDoc reader's guide
The modules and the classes within the modules are described under the *Modules* and *Classes* JSDoc pages. 
The structure of a custom calendar, that the user should provide, is described the *customcalendarmodel* module.
The *Global* page mostly describes scripts of the demonstrator. Have a look on *loadCalendrical* and *calendrical*
as examples for your personal implementation.
